================================================================================

The BIRD project is an attempt to create a routing daemon running on UNIX-like
systems (but not necessarily limited to them) with full support of all modern
routing protocols, easy to use configuration interface and powerful route
filtering language.

BIG FAT WARNING: This is still a development version which probably has lots
of bugs and missing features (including documentation); see below for what is
implemented and what still isn't.

Welcome to our alpha test team!  If you want to help us debugging, enhancing
and porting BIRD or just lurking around to see what's going to develop from
this strange creature, feel free to subscribe to the BIRD users mailing
list (bird-users@atrey.karlin.mff.cuni.cz, send subscribes to majordomo
at the same machine).  Bug reports, suggestions, feature requests (: and
code :) are welcome.

You can download the latest version from ftp://atrey.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/pub/bird/.

BIRD has been developed as a student project at the Faculty of Math
and Physics, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic under supervision
of RNDr. Libor Forst <forst@cuni.cz>.

How to install BIRD:

	./configure
	make
	make install
	vi /usr/local/etc/bird.conf

What do we support:

	o  Both IPv4 and IPv6 (use --enable-ipv6 when configuring)
	o  Multiple routing tables
	o  BGP
	o  RIP
	o  Partial implementation of OSPF (IPv4 only; soon to be
	   functional).
	o  Static routes
	o  Inter-table protocol
	o  Command-line interface (using the `birdc' client; to get
	   some help, just press `?')
	o  Soft reconfiguration -- no online commands for changing the
	   configuration in very limited ways, just edit the configuration
	   file and issue a `configure' command or send SIGHUP and BIRD
	   will start using the new configuration, possibly restarting
	   protocols affected by the configuration changes.
	o  Powerful language for route filtering (see doc/bird.conf.example).

Missing (see also the TODO file):

	o  Rest of OSPF
	o  Documentation (see the doc/ directory for a skeleton)


Good Luck and enjoy the BIRD :)
