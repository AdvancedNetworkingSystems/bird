Core
~~~~
- configure: default CFLAGS?

- filters: deletion of mandatory attributes?
- filters: user defined attributes?
- filters: arithmetics and define'd symbols

- kernel: persistent mode

- cli: show tables?

- client: Ctrl-R eats one more enter
- client: paging?
- client: data losses on large dumps?

- table: ocassional core dumps in rt_prune()
- table: do feeding by parts

- bgp: timing of updates?
- bgp: dump and get_route_info

- proto: Don't show repeated `Changed state to ...' messages if only internal states change

Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- write doctool
- write documentation :|

Globals
~~~~~~~
- right usage of DBG vs. debug
- logging and tracing; use appropriate log levels
- check incoming packets and log errors!!
- check log calls for trailing newlines and log levels followed by comma
- check if all protocols set proper packet priorities and TTL's.
- try compiling with -Wunused
- does everybody test return value of sk_open?
- doc: references to RFC's we did follow
- protocols: implement CLI hooks and per-procotol CLI commands
- protocols: implement reconfigure hook
- protocols: use locking
- check use of system includes and sprintf()

Various ideas
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- static: allow specifying a per-route filter program for setting route attributes?
- netlink: realms
- netlink: import Linux route attributes to our rta's, so that they can be filtered?
- config: executable config files
- client: access control
- io: use poll if available
- IPv6 router advertisements
- real multipath (doesn't seem to be simple at all :()
- fake multipath (even less simple)
- route recalculation timing and flap dampening [see RFC2439 for algorithms]
- aggregate engine: standard route aggregation and summarization [RFC2519]
- aggregate engine: injection of manually configured pseudo-static routes
- generate default route if any working BGP connection exists (aggregate engine again?)
- generate default route to IGP's (aggregate engine yet another time?)
- look at RFC 2386 (QoS-based routing)


OSPF
~~~~
	- refuse running on non-multicast devices
	- importing of device routes for networks where we don't run OSPF
	- check incoming packets using neighbor cache
	- RFC2328 appendix E: Use a better algorithm
	- automatic generation of external route tags (RFC1403)
	- RFC1587 NSSA areas
	- RFC2370 opaque LSA's
	- respect interface MTU and try not to create larger packets unless unavoidable
