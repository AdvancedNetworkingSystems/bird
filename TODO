Core
~~~~
- better memory allocators
- real attribute cache

- static: check validity of route destination?
- static: allow specifying a per-route filter program for setting route attributes?

- rte_update: check whether all bits not covered by masklen are zero
- rte_update: debug mode

- krt: rescan interfaces when route addition fails?

- tagging of external routes?

Commands
~~~~~~~~
- showing of routing table as seen by given protocol

Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- write doctool
- write documentation :|

Globals
~~~~~~~
- right usage of DBG vs. debug
- cleanup debugging calls
- logging and tracing; use appropriate log levels
- check incoming packets and log errors!!
- check log calls for trailing newlines
- check if all protocols set proper packet priorities and TTL's.
- replace all NUM, IPA and expr tokens by constant filter expressions
- try compiling with -Wunused
- does everybody test return value of sk_open?
- doc: references to RFC's we did follow
- protocols: implement CLI hooks and per-procotol CLI commands
- protocols: implement reconfigure hook
- protocols: use locking

Various ideas
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- netlink: import Linux route attributes to our rta's, so that they can be filtered?
- config: executable config files
- client: access control
- config: when parsing prefix, check zero bits
- io: use poll if available
- IPv6 router advertisements
- real multipath (doesn't seem to be simple at all :()
- fake multipath (even less simple)
- route recalculation timing and flap dampening [see RFC2439 for algorithms]
- aggregate engine: standard route aggregation and summarization [RFC2519]
- aggregate engine: injection of manually configured pseudo-static routes
- generate default route if any working BGP connection exists (aggregate engine again?)
- generate default route to IGP's (aggregate engine yet another time?)
- look at RFC 2386 (QoS-based routing)


RIP
~~~

OSPF
~~~~
	- refuse running on non-multicast devices
	- importing of device routes for networks where we don't run OSPF
	- check incoming packets using neighbor cache
	- RFC2328 appendix E: Use a better algorithm
	- automatic generation of external route tags (RFC1403)
	- RFC1587 NSSA areas
	- RFC2370 opaque LSA's
	- respect interface MTU and try not to create larger packets unless unavoidable

BGP
~~~
	- aggregation, ATOMIC_AGGREGATE
	- communities
	- attributes must be sorted!
	- re-export of NEXT_HOP attribute
	- BGP session over currently down interface
	- LOCAL_PREF attribute
	- error notification received -> log error
	- set TTL to 1 (configurable?)
	- consulting IGP for next-hop information? (what if it changes?)
	- inter-advertisement delay???!
	- normalize (sort) incoming AS-SET's
	- maximum length of AS paths
	- expected neighbor AS
	- hold time
	- idle timer after error: initial value, exponential growth, maximum value
	- import of IGP routes (use external route tags from OSPF)
	- Use IP_RECVERR for BGP TCP sockets?
