Core
~~~~
- TOS not supported by kernel -> automatically drop routes with TOS<>0

- config: executable config files
- config: define ipaddr constants?
- config: better default protocol names

- counters (according to SNMP MIB?)
- better memory allocators
- default preferences of protocols: prefer BGP over OSPF/RIP external routes?
- secondary addresses -> subinterfaces or ignore

- static: check validity of route destination?

- device: configuration of interface patterns

- adding of route: check whether all bits not covered by masklen are zero

- incoming packets: interface the packet came from? (esp. for multicasts)
- broadcast/multicast echoing suppresion
- we need ifindex at least for PtP links

- kernel: RTM_F_NOTIFY seems to be unimplemented
- kernel: RTM_DELROUTE not announced for device routes

- netlink: import Linux route attributes to our rta's, so that they can be filtered?

Cleanup
~~~~~~~
- right usage of DBG vs. debug
- cleanup debugging calls
- logging and tracing; use appropriate log levels
- check incoming packets and log errors!!
- check log calls for trailing newlines
- check if all protocols set proper packet priorities and TTL's.
- replace all NUM's by expr's

Various ideas
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- real multipath (doesn't seem to be simple at all :()
- fake multipath (even less simple)
- route recalculation timing and flap dampening [see RFC2439 for algorithms]
- aggregate engine: standard route aggregation and summarization
- aggregate engine: injection of manually configured pseudo-static routes
- generate default route if any working BGP connection exists (aggregate engine again?)
- generate default route to IGP's (aggregate engine yet another time?)


RIP
~~~
	- RIP: export-only and import-only mode?
	- drop RIPv1 (Historic protocol)?
	- Route Tag
	- limit routing table xfer (frequency, only to neighbors)
	- multicast on/off (per interface)

OSPF
~~~~
	- importing of device routes for networks where we don't run OSPF
	- check incoming packets using neighbor cache
	- stub area: either no external routes or only default route
	- RFC2328 appendix E: Use a better algorithm
	- automatic generation of external route tags (RFC1403)
	- RFC1587 NSSA areas
	- RFC2370 opaque LSA's
	- RFC1793 Demand Circuit Support ??
	- respect interface MTU and try not to create larger packets unless unavoidable


BGP
~~~
	- in, local, out RIB
	- maxsize=4096
	- detection of loops
	- aggregation, ATOMIC_AGGREGATE
	- communities
	- confederations
	- attributes must be sorted!
	- re-export of NEXT_HOP attribute
	- BGP session over currently down interface
	- LOCAL_PREF attribute
	- error notification received -> log error
	- set TTL to 1 (configurable?)
	- consulting IGP for next-hop information? (what if it changes?)
	- inter-advertisement delay???!
	- normalize (sort) incoming AS-SET's
	- maximum length of AS paths

	- expected neighbor AS
	- hold time
	- idle timer after error: initial value, exponential growth, maximum value
	- import of IGP routes (use external route tags from OSPF)
